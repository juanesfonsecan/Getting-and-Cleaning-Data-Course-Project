# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This repository contains the Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It creates the tidy.txt file by downloading the dataset to the working directory, loading the information from the activity, the feature, the training and the test datasets, and taking only the columns with means or standard deviations to merge them and present in the end the mean value of each variable for every subject and activity pair.
